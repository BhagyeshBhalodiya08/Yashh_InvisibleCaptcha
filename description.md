Improve your website user experience

Make your visitors satisfied with their shopping experience and protect forms on your website with Invisible reCaptcha. By setting up a captcha score, the store admin can precisely define requests that will be considered suspicious. This way, the real shoppers won't need to solve any tests when browsing your store.

Show reCaptcha only for guest users

Most customers find reCaptcha annoying. Don't try the patience of your registered clients and display a captcha only for guest visitors. This will help you to take up two challenges at once: you'll protect your store website and won't lose customers. Also, you can make up an IP whitelist to mark specific traffic as trustworthy. Invisible Captcha will be disabled for the IP addresses specified in the list.


Full support of the reCaptcha v3

Google Invisible reCaptcha doesn't push your customers to solve quizzes if a session seems to be unsuspicious. The reCaptcha test appears only in case of suspicious requests. Admin can incorporate the necessary reCaptcha version that fits the website's needs the best.


Display custom reCaptcha message

Sometimes even real shoppers don’t pass the reCaptcha v3 test. It happens if they did something to trigger Google spam detection. To avoid the real shoppers’ confusion, you can create a user-friendly explanation message about how to act in case of a failed validation test.




No more spam bots in comments and reviews

You can add Google Invisible reCaptcha to your comment and review forms. You don't need to waste your time on manual spam filtering — let users see only trustworthy content that motivates them to purchase more.

Invisible reCaptcha on the registration form

Spam at registration forms could drive any admin user mad. By using a reCaptcha option you protect your store from spam bots at both login and registration forms. Also, you can add Magento 2 Сaptcha to the newsletter form if needed.
